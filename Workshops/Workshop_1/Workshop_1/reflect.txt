I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and 
I only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my 
workshops and assignments. This submitted piece of work has not 
been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.
*****************************************************************/

This workshops was quite straightforward and simple as it a refresher on what we did in last semester.
I did not face any major difficulties.

The difference in internal and external linkage is that when a variable is defined internally like
"static int count = 0;" in the display function the variable count can not be affected by other 
parts of the program.

whereas the a variable is defined externally like the "extern double g_taxrate;" and 
"extern double g_dailydiscount;" in the FoodOrder header file, they are accessible and modifiable
across multiple files in our program.

In my solution the use of the static variable "static int count = 0;" is used to keep track of how
many time the display function has been called. It is used because it is only relevant to the display
function and we don't need to use global variable, making it more efficient.

The changes that I made to the FoodOrder class were they way the m_orderDescription was defined
so I can dynamically allocate memory i also added a default constructor that initializes all data members
to an empty safe state, a copy constructor that copies an existing object to a new one,
a copy assignment operator that copies an object to an existing object, and a destructor which deallocates memory.
