we define the class objects and methods outside the class definition to
separate the interface from the implementation for more clear code and
better maintainability.

Specializing the definition of m_smallestItem and m_largestItem for Book 
with a capacity of 10 ensures that these static members are properly 
instantiated and managed for this specific type and capacity
