I declare that this submission is the result of my own work and
I only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my
workshops and assignments. This submitted piece of work has not
been shared with any other student or 3rd party content provider.
*****************************************************************/

list all the STL functions that you have used in this workshop; explain your reasoning for choosing each one, and not another.

std::find_if,
std::copy_if
std::sort,
std::merge,
std::accumulate,
std::for_each,
std::list::sort,

The reason for choosing these function is that they are more efficient, easier to use, and more readable than manually implementing the functions.



present the advantages of using STL algorithms vs. implementing the functionality by yourself using loops.

the STL Functions are more reliable and consistent making it easier to understand the code, it's easier to reuse than implementing it for every module or creating our own library, there are chances of errors and bugs, the functions are optimized and are efficient.



for the sortBakery function, would anything differ in how it is implemented if the choice of collection was either a vector or a list? If there is a difference what is it?

If the implementation was a list we would use it's own member function sort that using the STL sort.
