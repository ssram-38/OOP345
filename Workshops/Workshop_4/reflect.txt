*****************************************************************/
Composition and aggregation are two types of association. the differences between them are
Composition relationships are where the child object cannot exist independently of the parent
their both created and destroyed the same time.

whereas the aggregation relationships the child object can exist independently of the parent object. 


the copy constructor and move constructor differ as the copy one creates a new
object and keeps both objects separately with their own memory whereas the 
move constructor move the data from one object to another keeping the same 
memory location and deleting the other.
